You can’t create the right abstraction until you fully understand the code, but the existence of the wrong abstraction may prevent you from ever doing so. This suggests that you should not reach for abstractions, but instead, you should resist them until they absolutely insist upon being created.

The code you write should meet two often contradictory goals. It must remain concrete enough to be understood while simultaneously being abstract enough to allow for change.

The best solution for most problems lies somewhere in the middle. There’s a sweet spot that represents the perfect compromise between comprehension and changeability, and it’s your job as a programmer to find it.

Design is thus about picking the right abstractions.
